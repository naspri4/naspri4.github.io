						Rustic Meadows is 10 acres of spacious country setting with pine trees, aspens, and a large meadow; the perfect place for you special country moment.

						Located just 15 minutes from downtown Spokane, Rustic Meadows has been our home since 2008. We are a family owned and operated venue, inspired by our own son's wedding.

						We love having a place to enjoy the outdoors in a peaceful, quiet setting and having been married 30 years ourselves, we hope to share our home with you and be a part of your new beginning.
